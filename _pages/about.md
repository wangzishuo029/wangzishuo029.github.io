Hello! I'm Zishuo Wang (王梓烁), currently a Master's Student at [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology, Peking University](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn). My research interests primarily focus on Multimodal and Computer Vision, with a particular emphasis on Open-Vocabulary Learning. 

I am pursuing my Master's degree at [Multimedia Information Processing Lab (MIPL)](http://39.108.48.32/mipl/home), under the supervision of [Prof. Yuxin Peng](http://39.108.48.32/mipl/pengyuxin).

Beyond academia, I am passionate about football and Hip-Hop music, which helps me stay creative and motivated in my research work.
